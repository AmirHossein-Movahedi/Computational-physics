## 🎯 Purpose

As the Teaching Assistant (TA) for this course, this repository serves two main purposes:

1.  **Reference for TAs/Instructors:** Provides organized, verified solutions and associated code for quick checking and grading of student submissions.
2.  **Student Resource:** Offers official solutions after the due date to aid student learning, review, and understanding of the core computational concepts.

## ⚠️ Important Note for Students

* **Do not use these solutions to cheat.** Referencing this material before the due date is strictly prohibited and violates the course's academic honesty policy.
* These files are provided as a **study tool** to reinforce the concepts covered in the course after the assignment has been submitted and graded.
